# 🚖 Taxi Booking App (Customer Side)

Welcome to the official **Taxi Booking App for Customers** – your smart and simple solution to find nearby registered drivers and book your ride instantly. This app connects you with professional drivers within just a 1 km radius and lets you choose the best offer based on your needs.

---

## 🔍 Search Nearby Drivers

Our app uses your location to find all drivers registered with our system in real-time. Once a ride request is sent, nearby drivers can respond with their offers. You will receive multiple offers and can pick the one that best suits your preferences – price, ETA, or driver rating.

---

## 📬 Receive and Accept Offers

Each customer receives personalized ride offers from available drivers. Offers include price and estimated time. You have full control to **accept** or **ignore** offers based on your needs. Once accepted, your ride is booked and the driver's location becomes visible.

---

## 🗺️ Live Map Tracking

After confirming a ride, track your driver’s movement **live on the map**. You’ll always know how far your ride is and when to expect arrival. This ensures a transparent and trustworthy experience every time.

---

## 📞 Communication & Cancellation

You can **call** your driver anytime for coordination. If plans change, there’s also an easy option to **cancel the ride** directly from the app. Your convenience and flexibility are our priority.

---

## 📁 Order History

All your past bookings are securely stored in the app, so you can view previous ride details, date/time, and driver information. This helps keep your ride records organized and accessible anytime you need.

---

## ⚠️ Note

> 📌 **Please make sure to add your `Places API Key` and `Maps API Key` in the `strings.xml` file**. Without these keys, the map and nearby place suggestions **will not work**.
